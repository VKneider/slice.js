<h1>Slice Documentation</h1>
<p>
  The Slice Framework is based on a modular structure grounded in components,
  providing a solid foundation for building web clients. This modular
  architecture allows developers to divide the framework's functionality into
  independent and reusable components, easing maintenance and extension.
  Similarly, web clients are built following the same component-based approach,
  involving the creation of user interfaces and application functionalities by
  combining and configuring predefined components. This process streamlines
  development and promotes code reuse.
  <p>
    Regarding component classification, they are divided into three main
    categories: <span>Visual</span>, <span>Structural</span>, and <span>Services</span>. Visual components
    are essential for building web client interfaces, while structural ones
    provide the necessary infrastructure to manage and monitor all aspects of
    the framework and the application. On the other hand, services encapsulate
    the business logic of the application and provide the ability to manage
    technologies associated with the web client, such as HTTP requests and local
    storage. Additionally, visual components and user services are included,
    which are created by developers for specific projects using the framework.

<div class="visualComponents">
    <h2>Visual Components</h2>
    <p>
        These components play a fundamental role in building web client interfaces. They are based on custom HTML tags and make use of the Web Components API. By combining these tags with JavaScript classes, the necessary logic to manipulate these components efficiently is encapsulated, allowing developers to cover a wide range of functionalities according to their needs, from simple style changes like font color to dynamically creating new components. Additionally, these components can interact with the backend through HTTP requests, enabling operations such as data retrieval, form submission, or updating the user interface in response to specific events.
    </p>

<div class="structuralComponents">
    <h2>Structural Components</h2>
    <p>
        These components are essential for the comprehensive functioning of the framework, as they provide the necessary infrastructure to manage and monitor all aspects of it and the application to be developed. Within this category, there are components responsible for controlling the instances of elements, allowing for efficient and dynamic handling of them. Additionally, they offer tools for registering and tracking activities in real-time, facilitating error debugging and performance analysis during the development and execution of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="serviceComponents">
    <h2>Service Components</h2>
    <p>Services constitute a fundamental type of component that plays a key role in web application development. Their main function lies in encapsulating the business logic of the application, facilitating code reuse, and enhancing the readability and effectiveness of the development process. In addition to addressing the specific logic of the application, services offer the ability to encapsulate and manage various technologies associated with the web client, such as handling HTTP requests, local storage (localStorage), and accessing and modifying indexed databases (indexedDB), among others.</p>

<h1>Components by developers</h1>
<div>
    <h2>User Visual Components</h2>
    <p>These components possess the same characteristics as the "Visual" category components but differ in that they are created by developers for their specific projects, whereas the "Visual" category components are created by the Framework developers.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>User Service Components</h2>
    <p>Similarly to user visual components, they share the characteristic of being created by developers for their specific projects using the Framework and possess the same characteristics as components in the "Service" category or services.</p>
